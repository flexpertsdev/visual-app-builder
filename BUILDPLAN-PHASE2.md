3. **Real-time Canvas Updates**
   - Connect AI modifications to appStore
   - Add visual feedback during updates
   - Implement undo/redo functionality

### Phase 9: Progressive Zoom Detail Rendering
**Goal**: Show appropriate detail at each zoom level

#### Tasks:
1. **Define Detail Levels**
   - Level 1 (App Overview): Show journey map with colored paths
   - Level 2 (Screen Flow): Show screen cards with connections
   - Level 3 (Screen Detail): Show screen content and features
   - Level 4 (Feature Detail): Show individual features within screens
   - Level 5 (Component Level): Show UI components

2. **Implement Conditional Rendering**
   - Update ScreenCard to render based on zoom level
   - Add JourneyOverlay component for Level 1
   - Create FeatureGrid component for Level 4
   - Add ComponentView for Level 5

3. **Smooth Transitions**
   - Add fade in/out for detail levels
   - Implement progressive loading of details
   - Optimize performance for large projects

### Phase 10: Context-Aware Add Button
**Goal**: Make the Add button intelligent based on zoom level and context

#### Tasks:
1. **Context Detection**
   - Detect current zoom level
   - Identify what's under the cursor (screen, feature, empty space)
   - Determine appropriate items to add

2. **Dynamic Menu Options**
   - Level 1: Add Journey
   - Level 2: Add Screen
   - Level 3: Add Feature to Screen
   - Level 4: Add UI Section
   - Level 5: Add Component

3. **Smart Positioning**
   - Auto-position new items based on context
   - Auto-zoom to appropriate level after adding
   - Connect new items to existing flow

## UI/UX Improvements (Priority 2)

### Phase 11: Left Panel AI Chat
**Goal**: Move chat from floating to left panel for better workspace

#### Tasks:
1. **Layout Restructure**
   - Create three-panel layout (left: chat, center: canvas, right: properties)
   - Make panels resizable
   - Add collapse/expand functionality

2. **Enhanced Chat Interface**
   - Full-height chat with better message history
   - Code/JSON preview in messages
   - Inline action buttons
   - Search through chat history

3. **Persistent Chat State**
   - Save chat history to localStorage
   - Restore on project load
   - Export chat as documentation

### Phase 12: Advanced Features

#### 12.1 Smart Templates
- Industry-specific app templates
- AI analysis of similar apps
- One-click template application

#### 12.2 Design System Enhancement
- Live theme preview
- Component style variations
- Export design tokens

#### 12.3 Collaboration Features
- Share project via link
- Comment on screens
- Version history

#### 12.4 Export Capabilities
- Export to React code
- Generate API specifications
- Create documentation

## Project Export System (Priority 1)

### Phase 14: AI-Ready Export System
**Goal**: Generate comprehensive markdown specifications that allow autonomous app building

#### Tasks:
1. **Export Service Creation**
   - Create ExportService class
   - Generate 5 specialized markdown files
   - Include all necessary context for AI builders

2. **Markdown File Specifications**
   
   **1. DESIGN_SYSTEM.md**
   - Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
   - Tailwind configuration
   - Breakpoints and responsive behavior
   - Navigation patterns
   - Component styling rules
   
   **2. FEATURES_JOURNEYS.md**
   - User journeys with flow diagrams
   - Feature specifications
   - User stories and acceptance criteria
   - Interaction patterns
   - Business logic rules
   
   **3. PAGES_COMPONENTS.md**
   - Complete file tree structure
   - Component hierarchy
   - Props and state for each component
   - Package.json with dependencies
   - Import/export relationships
   
   **4. PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md**
   - App description and purpose
   - Technical stack decisions
   - Architecture overview
   - API requirements
   - Database schema (if applicable)
   
   **5. AI_BUILD_TASKS.md**
   - Self-executing task list
   - Step-by-step build instructions
   - Changelog of decisions made
   - Testing requirements
   - Deployment instructions

3. **Export UI Integration**
   - Add "Export Project" button to header
   - Show export preview
   - Download as ZIP or copy to clipboard
   - Version control integration

## Technical Debt & Performance

### Phase 13: Optimization
1. **Performance**
   - Virtualize large canvas renders
   - Optimize re-renders with React.memo
   - Implement lazy loading for features

2. **Code Quality**
   - Add comprehensive TypeScript types
   - Implement error boundaries
   - Add loading states

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for stores
   - Integration tests for AI service
   - E2E tests for critical flows

## Implementation Order

1. **Week 1-2**: Phase 8 (AI → Canvas Integration) 
2. **Week 2-3**: Phase 14 (AI-Ready Export System) - Critical for project portability
3. **Week 3-4**: Phase 9 (Progressive Zoom)
4. **Week 5**: Phase 10 (Context-Aware Add)
5. **Week 6-7**: Phase 11 (Left Panel Chat)
6. **Week 8+**: Phase 12-13 (Advanced Features & Optimization)

## Success Metrics

- Users can describe their app and see it built visually
- Zoom levels provide intuitive detail progression
- Add button feels intelligent and context-aware
- Chat interface feels like a natural part of the workflow
- Performance remains smooth with 100+ screens

## Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 8 implementation
2. Get user feedback after each phase
3. Adjust priorities based on usage patterns
4. Consider backend integration for Phase 12
